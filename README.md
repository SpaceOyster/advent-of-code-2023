# [Advent Of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)
It's the most wonderfull time of the year 2023 :)

I post my solutions almost as is, without making it super optimal, just doing a
little cleanup to remove irrelevant clutter and make it more readable.

And, yeah, it's in Haskell.

Also inputs in `/inputs` dir are unique for each user, if I understood #aoc
correctly. These are inputs I got.

- [X] Day One
- [X] Day Two
- [X] Day Three
- [X] Day Four
- [X] Day Five
- [X] Day Six
- [X] Day Seven
- [X] Day Eight
- [X] Day Nine
- [ ] Day Ten
- [ ] Day Eleven
- [ ] Day Twelve
- [ ] Day Thirteen
- [ ] Day Fourteen
- [ ] Day Fivteen
- [ ] Day Sixteen
